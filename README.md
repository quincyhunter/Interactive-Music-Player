6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
Not really I just thought it would be fun to incoportate the hand gestures with music

7. Describe the two custom gestures you created.
I created a swipe left and a swipe right when the user is pointing.
It detects 2 hand positions in a row and if they reach the distance threshold 
then it is recognized as a swipe gesture

8. How does your app implement or follow principles of good UI design?
My app follows principles of good UI design mainly involving simplicity but is still visually appealing. 
I added a lot of UI friendly features like a queue menu which could be toggled, a shuffle library feature, as well
optional cover art uploads. I tried to also make the handtracker follow principles of good UI design by ensuring 
that gestures wouldn't interfere with themselves too much.
